# EggAnalysis2

Library for analyzing EEG and ECoG data.
Work in progress, not to be used/trusted yet.

## General Functionality
* Create a session with desired name and directory
* Use load_eeg function to load data into the session from specific channels
* Use lowpass_session or highpass_session to filter the session
* Create plot using the appropriate plotting function

## To-do list:
* Check spectrogram computations (colorbar looks weird)
* Change filename input so that it can take the right usernames
